# ðŸ§© Problem: 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

## ðŸ“œ Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their longest common subsequence*.  

A **subsequence** of a string is a sequence that can be derived from the string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

- **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The LCS is "ace"
    ```

- **Constraints:**
  - `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
  - `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English letters.
